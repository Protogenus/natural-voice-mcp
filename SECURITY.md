## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue for security-related problems.**

Instead, report privately by:
- Opening a GitHub Security Advisory (preferred), or
- Contacting the repository owner directly via GitHub.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

You can expect an initial response within a reasonable time frame.  
If the vulnerability is confirmed, it will be patched and disclosed once a fix is available.

## Scope

This project is experimental and provided as-is. While reasonable effort is made to address security issues, there is no formal SLA or bug bounty program.

That said, responsible reports are taken seriously and appreciated.
