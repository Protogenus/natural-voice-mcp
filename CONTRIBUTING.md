# Contributing to Natural Voice MCP

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Natural Voice MCP**. The goal of this project is to make AI output more natural, human, and conversational. Contributions that move the project in that direction are welcome.

## Guiding Principles

This project values:
- Practical improvements over theoretical ones
- Readable, maintainable code
- Real-world usefulness over hype or buzzwords
- Human language patterns, not “AI-flavored” writing

If a contribution makes the system more complex without making it more effective, it probably doesn’t belong.

## What You Can Contribute

Some good areas to contribute:

- Improvements to language modeling rules
- Heuristics for more natural phrasing
- Detection or reduction of “AI tells”
- Better examples or datasets
- Documentation and usage guides
- Bug fixes and performance improvements

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch  
   `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with a clear message  
   `git commit -m "Improve conversational tone handling"`
5. Push to your fork  
   `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
6. Open a Pull Request

## Code Style

- Keep things simple and readable
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Prefer explicit logic over clever tricks
- Comment *why* something exists, not what it does

This is a system meant to model human communication — the code should reflect that philosophy.

## Pull Request Guidelines

A good PR:
- Solves a real problem
- Explains the intent clearly
- Doesn’t introduce breaking changes without reason
- Includes examples if behavior changes

Low-effort PRs, auto-generated code, or “AI-written” contributions without human review may be rejected.

## Philosophy

This project is skeptical of modern AI hype and focuses on a simple idea:
**Humans write in patterns. Those patterns can be modeled.**

If your contribution respects that premise, it probably fits here.
