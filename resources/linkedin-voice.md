# LinkedIn Voice Guide

LinkedIn is weird. It's professional but personal, polished but authentic, corporate but human. Understanding this tension is key.

## The LinkedIn Paradox

People on LinkedIn are:
- Building their professional brand
- Networking with intention
- Sharing genuine insights
- Sometimes being vulnerable
- But always aware they're being watched by colleagues, bosses, recruiters

This creates a unique voice: professional authenticity.

## What Works on LinkedIn

### The Narrative Post
People love stories with arcs:
- **The Failure:** "3 years ago, I got fired. Here's what I learned."
- **The Behind-Scenes:** "What no one tells you about [role/industry]"
- **The Pivot:** "I left [impressive job] to [risky move]. Here's why."
- **The Lesson:** "After 10 years in [field], here's what matters most."

Structure:
1. Hook (often starts with context/time)
2. Challenge/conflict
3. Action/learning
4. Outcome/lesson
5. Universal takeaway

### The Insight Post
Short, punchy observations:
- "The best [professionals] do this one thing differently"
- "Here's what 100 interviews taught me about [topic]"
- "Unpopular opinion: [contrarian take with nuance]"

Not preachy, not obvious, specific.

### The Vulnerable Share
Authenticity with boundaries:
- Admitting imposter syndrome
- Sharing rejections that led to success
- Discussing mental health (professionally)
- Work-life balance struggles

But NOT:
- Oversharing personal drama
- Trauma dumping
- Complaining without growth
- Burning bridges publicly

## Tone Balance

### Professional ≠ Corporate Speak
**Don't sound like:**
- "Leveraging synergies to maximize stakeholder value"
- "Excited to announce I've joined [company] to drive innovation"
- "Thrilled to share best practices around [thing]"

**Sound like:**
- "Here's what I learned about [thing]"
- "I joined [company] to work on [specific problem]"
- "Some thoughts on [thing] after [experience]"

### Personal ≠ Oversharing
**Good personal:**
- "Juggling deadlines with a newborn is wild. Here's what helped."
- "My kid asked me what I do all day. Explaining UX design to a 6-year-old was humbling."

**Too personal:**
- Family drama details
- Medical specifics
- Relationship issues
- Political rants (mostly)

### Humble ≠ False Modesty
**Authentic:**
- "Proud of what the team built"
- "This was hard, but we figured it out"
- "Still learning, but here's what's working"

**False:**
- "Humbled and honored" (overused to death)
- "I'm just a [role] but..." (you're not "just" anything)
- "Not an expert but..." then proceeds with expertise

## Post Structure Patterns

### The Hook
First line is everything. Start with:
- Context: "5 years ago..."
- Question: "Why do so many [people] struggle with [thing]?"
- Statement: "I made a $50K mistake last year."
- Observation: "I've interviewed 200+ candidates. Here's what stands out."

NOT:
- "I wanted to share some thoughts..."
- "Here's something I've been thinking about..."
- Burying the lede

### The Body
LinkedIn rewards readability:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Line breaks between thoughts
- Bold or italics for emphasis (but sparingly)
- Lists when appropriate (3-5 items, not 20)

People scroll. Make it scannable.

### The Close
End with:
- Question to audience ("What's worked for you?")
- Clear takeaway ("The lesson: [thing]")
- Call to action (subtle, not salesy)
- Open loop ("More on this soon")

NOT:
- "Thoughts?" (lazy)
- "Agree?" (engagement bait)
- "DM me to learn more" (unless genuinely helpful)

## Content Types That Land

### Career Advice
- Specific, actionable (not platitudes)
- Based on real experience
- Acknowledges nuance
- Example: "Here's how I negotiated a 40% raise (with exact scripts)"

NOT: "10 tips for success: 1. Work hard 2. Be yourself..."

### Industry Insights
- Contrarian but defensible
- Backed by data or experience
- Timely and relevant
- Example: "Everyone says [common advice]. Here's why that's changing."

NOT: "AI is transforming everything!" [no specifics]

### Behind the Scenes
- Show the process, not just results
- Include failures and messy middle
- Make it relatable
- Example: "Here's what my first draft looked like vs final"

NOT: Just showcasing wins

### Company/Team Celebrations
- Specific about what was achieved
- Credit the team genuinely
- Tell the story of how
- Example: "6 months ago we had an idea. Here's how it became [thing]."

NOT: "Excited to announce [vague achievement]"

## Voice Nuances

### How to Use "I"
LinkedIn allows first person, but:
- "I learned" > "I think everyone should"
- "I tried this" > "I'm the best at this"
- "I failed at" > "I succeeded easily at"

Be the protagonist but not the hero of every story.

### Hashtags
Use 3-5 relevant ones, max:
- Mix of broad (#leadership) and specific (#productmanagement)
- End of post, not inline
- Actually relevant to content
- Not #every #word #like #this

### Mentions
Tag people when:
- They deserve credit
- You're continuing their idea
- It adds value to mention them

Don't tag:
- To get attention from influencers who don't know you
- More than 3-4 people
- Irrelevantly

### Emojis
Sparingly. LinkedIn isn't emoji-free but:
- 1-2 per post max
- Professional context (✅ 📊 💡 are safer than 🔥 💯)
- Never replace words entirely
- Skip them if it feels forced

## Authenticity vs Algorithm

### The Algorithm Wants:
- Engagement (comments > likes)
- Dwell time (people read the whole thing)
- Shares (people tag others)
- Consistency (regular posting)

### Humans Want:
- Genuine insights
- Relatable experiences
- Useful information
- Real personality

The overlap is your sweet spot. Don't sacrifice authenticity for engagement, but be aware that format matters.

## Red Flags (AI Tells on LinkedIn)

❌ "I'm thrilled to announce"
❌ "Humbled and honored"
❌ "Delighted to share"
❌ Starting every post the same way
❌ No personality whatsoever
❌ Generic motivational quotes
❌ "Success is not final, failure is not fatal"
❌ Lists of obvious advice
❌ Perfectly structured 10-point frameworks every time

## Voice Examples by Professional Context

### Founder/Entrepreneur
"We almost ran out of money in month 3. Here's the conversation that saved us."
"Raised our Series A. Here's what surprised me about the process."
"Bootstrapping isn't romantic. Here are the real numbers."

### Mid-Career Professional
"5 years into [role], here's what I wish I knew starting out"
"Just wrapped a project that almost broke me. Here's what I'd do differently."
"Switching teams taught me more than I expected about [thing]"

### Senior Leader
"After 20 years, the one thing that still matters most is [thing]"
"I've hired 100+ people. Here's what actually predicts success."
"The hardest lesson in leadership: [specific, not obvious]"

### Career Changer
"Left [prestigious thing] for [risky thing]. 6 months in, here's the truth."
"Everyone said I was crazy to pivot to [field]. They weren't wrong."
"Here's what transferable skills actually means in practice"

## The LinkedIn Vibe Check

Read your post. Does it:
- ✅ Sound like you talking to a respected colleague?
- ✅ Offer something specific and useful?
- ✅ Have personality without being unprofessional?
- ✅ Feel genuine rather than performative?
- ❌ Sound like a corporate press release?
- ❌ Feel like you're trying too hard to inspire?
- ❌ Read like everyone else's posts?

## Remember

LinkedIn is professional social media. It's:
- More polished than Twitter
- More personal than a resume
- More authentic than marketing copy
- More story-driven than a blog

People are there to:
- Learn from others' experiences
- Build genuine connections
- Advance their careers thoughtfully
- See the human side of work

Your voice should reflect that. Professional but real. Polished but honest. Authoritative but approachable.

The best LinkedIn content teaches something while feeling like a conversation with someone you respect.
