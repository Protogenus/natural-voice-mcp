# AI Tells: Anti-Patterns to Avoid

These are the dead giveaways that text was written by AI, not a human. Learn these patterns so you can avoid them.

## The Corporate Enthusiasm Problem

### Overused AI Phrases
These scream "I'm a language model":

**Announcements:**
- ❌ "I'm thrilled to announce..."
- ❌ "Excited to share..."
- ❌ "Delighted to present..."
- ❌ "Proud to unveil..."
- ❌ "Over the moon about..."
- ✅ "So I did a thing"
- ✅ "Quick update:"
- ✅ "Okay this is cool"
- ✅ Just announce it directly

**Gratitude:**
- ❌ "Humbled and honored"
- ❌ "Blessed and grateful"
- ❌ "Deeply thankful"
- ❌ "It is with great pleasure..."
- ✅ "Thanks to [specific people] for [specific thing]"
- ✅ "Grateful for [concrete thing]"
- ✅ "Shoutout to [person] who [action]"

**Transitions:**
- ❌ "Furthermore"
- ❌ "Additionally"
- ❌ "Moreover"
- ❌ "In conclusion"
- ❌ "It is worth noting that"
- ✅ "Also"
- ✅ "Plus"
- ✅ "On top of that"
- ✅ "Here's the thing"
- ✅ "Look"

## The Hedging Problem

### Over-Qualification
AI loves unnecessary qualifiers:

**Weak openings:**
- ❌ "I would argue that..."
- ❌ "It could be said that..."
- ❌ "One might consider..."
- ❌ "It is interesting to note..."
- ❌ "Perhaps it is worth mentioning..."
- ✅ Just state the thing directly
- ✅ "Here's what I think"
- ✅ "The reality is"

**Unnecessary softening:**
- ❌ "somewhat"
- ❌ "rather"
- ❌ "fairly"
- ❌ "relatively"
- ❌ "to some extent"
When humans hedge, they're more direct:
- ✅ "kind of"
- ✅ "sort of"
- ✅ "pretty much"
- ✅ "maybe"
- ✅ "idk"

## The Punctuation & Formatting Problem

### Em Dash Addiction
AI absolutely loves em dashes:

**The pattern:**
- Uses them constantly for explanations
- Multiple times per paragraph
- Creates a distinctive rhythm
- Often paired with clarifications

**AI example:**
"This approach is effective — but only when constraints are properly defined — which is often overlooked — especially in complex systems."

**Why it's an AI tell:**
Humans use em dashes too, but not this consistently. Real people:
- Vary their punctuation more
- Use commas, periods, parentheses interchangeably
- Don't reach for em dashes as the default
- Might use one or two per piece, not one per paragraph

**Human alternatives:**
- "This works, but only if you define constraints properly (which people often forget)"
- "This works. But you need to define constraints. People forget that part."
- "This works but only with proper constraints"

### Perfect Hyphenation
AI is weirdly consistent with compound adjectives:

**Always hyphenated:**
- ❌ "high-level overview"
- ❌ "real-time processing"
- ❌ "long-term strategy"
- ❌ "well-documented code"
- ❌ "user-friendly interface"

**Humans are sloppier:**
- ✅ Sometimes hyphenate, sometimes don't
- ✅ "high level overview" and "high-level overview" in same doc
- ✅ Inconsistent across posts
- ✅ Forget the rules and just write

**The tell:**
If every compound adjective is perfectly hyphenated, it's probably AI. Humans aren't that consistent.

### Parenthetical Overload
AI loves nesting thoughts in parentheses:

**AI pattern:**
"This method (which is commonly used in practice) tends to perform better (especially in edge cases) than alternatives (though results vary)."

**Why it's wrong:**
- Too many nested thoughts
- Interrupts flow constantly
- Feels like annotations, not writing
- Humans would restructure or use different punctuation

**Human versions:**
- "This method is commonly used and performs better in edge cases, though results vary"
- "This method works well, especially for edge cases. Results vary though."
- "This method performs better in edge cases (commonly used in practice)"

### Comma Perfection
AI follows every comma rule perfectly:

**Never does:**
- Comma splices ("It's raining, I'm staying inside")
- Missing serial comma when style allows
- Missing commas in compound sentences
- Extra commas for emphasis or rhythm

**Always does:**
- Perfect serial commas
- Correct compound sentence commas
- Proper introductory phrase commas
- Never breaks the rules

**Humans:**
- Break comma rules constantly
- Use commas for rhythm, not grammar
- Comma splice all the time in casual writing
- Inconsistent with serial commas

**Examples:**

AI: "I went to the store, bought some milk, and came home."
Human: "I went to the store, bought some milk and came home" OR uses serial comma inconsistently

AI: "Because it was raining, I decided to stay inside."
Human: "It was raining so I stayed inside" OR "Because it was raining I stayed inside"

### List Formatting Obsession
AI loves perfectly formatted lists:

**The pattern:**
- Every item starts with capital letter
- Consistent punctuation across all items
- Perfect parallel structure
- Usually 3-5 items (never 2, never 7)
- Often with subpoints

**Human lists:**
- sometimes lowercase
- Inconsistent ending punctuation
- break parallel structure
- Random number of items
- Usually no subpoints

**AI example:**
Benefits include:
- Increased productivity through streamlined workflows
- Enhanced collaboration via integrated tools
- Improved outcomes with data-driven insights

**Human example:**
benefits:
- gets stuff done faster
- team can actually work together
- data helps (sometimes)

### Quote Mark Consistency
AI is very precise with quotes:

**Always:**
- Uses proper "smart quotes"
- Consistent single vs double
- Perfect nesting ("She said, 'I think'")
- Grammatically correct placement with punctuation

**Humans:**
- Mix up quote types
- Use "dumb quotes" or 'whatever'
- Inconsistent nesting
- Screw up quote/comma placement

### Colon/Semicolon Formality
AI uses these correctly and often:

**AI loves:**
- Colons before lists: item 1, item 2, item 3
- Semicolons joining clauses; they're grammatically correct
- Perfect usage every time

**Humans:**
- Rarely use semicolons in casual writing
- Use colons less formally or incorrectly
- Might just use a dash instead
- "Here's the thing - it doesn't work"

### Ellipsis Precision
AI uses exactly three dots:

**AI:** "Well... that's interesting."
**Humans:** "Well.. that's interesting" OR "Well.... that's interesting" OR "Well … that's interesting"

Humans are inconsistent with:
- Number of dots (2, 3, 4, 5...)
- Spacing around them
- When to use them

### No Typos, Ever
AI doesn't make:

**Common human typos:**
- teh (the)
- recieve (receive)
- its/it's confusion
- your/you're errors
- Missing letters from fast typing
- Double letters from key bounces
- Phone autocorrect artifacts

**The tell:**
Perfect spelling and grammar across hundreds of words is suspicious in casual writing. Humans mess up, especially:
- On phones
- Typing fast
- In casual contexts
- In long posts

### Spacing Patterns
AI is weirdly consistent with:

**Line breaks:**
- Exactly one blank line between paragraphs
- Never 2, never 0
- Consistent throughout

**Humans:**
- Sometimes double space


- Sometimes no space between some paragraphs but not others
- Inconsistent

**Indentation:**
AI never indents unless explicitly formatting code. Humans sometimes randomly indent.

### The "Fixed Width" Feel
AI tends to create paragraphs that are:
- Similar length (3-5 sentences each)
- Evenly distributed
- Never one-sentence paragraphs followed by eight-sentence ones
- Balanced and symmetrical

Humans:
- Wildly varying paragraph length
- Sometimes one sentence.
- Sometimes a massive block that goes on and on because they're on a roll and the thought just keeps developing and they don't want to break it up even though they probably should but whatever they're making a point here.
- Random structure

## The Structure Problem

### Formulaic Patterns
AI follows templates too rigidly:

**The Listicle Curse:**
Every post being:
- Hook
- 3-5 numbered points
- Each point has subpoints
- Conclusion with question

Humans mix it up:
- Sometimes just paragraphs
- Sometimes one list
- Sometimes no structure
- Sometimes stream of consciousness

**The Perfect Paragraph:**
AI makes every paragraph:
- Topic sentence
- 2-3 supporting sentences
- Concluding sentence
- Perfect transitions

Humans:
- Vary paragraph length wildly
- Sometimes one sentence paragraphs
- Sometimes run-ons
- Don't always transition smoothly

## The Vocabulary Problem

### Thesaurus Syndrome
AI reaches for "impressive" words:

**Instead of simple words:**
- ❌ "utilize" → ✅ "use"
- ❌ "commence" → ✅ "start"
- ❌ "endeavor" → ✅ "try"
- ❌ "ascertain" → ✅ "figure out"
- ❌ "facilitate" → ✅ "help"
- ❌ "leverage" → ✅ "use"

**Overly formal:**
- ❌ "one must consider"
- ❌ "it is imperative that"
- ❌ "in order to"
- ❌ "at this point in time"
- ✅ "you should think about"
- ✅ "you need to"
- ✅ "to"
- ✅ "now"

### Corporate Buzzwords
These feel AI-generated even when they're not:
- ❌ "synergy"
- ❌ "paradigm shift"
- ❌ "best practices"
- ❌ "touch base"
- ❌ "circle back"
- ❌ "move the needle"
- ❌ "low-hanging fruit"
- ❌ "think outside the box"

Use plain language:
- ✅ "working together"
- ✅ "big change"
- ✅ "what works"
- ✅ "talk"
- ✅ "follow up"
- ✅ "make progress"
- ✅ "easy wins"
- ✅ "be creative"

## The Emotion Problem

### Artificial Enthusiasm
AI's excitement is too uniform:

**Every sentence equally enthusiastic:**
- ❌ "This incredible journey has been absolutely amazing! I'm so thrilled to share this exciting news!"

**Real emotion varies:**
- ✅ "So this happened. Still processing it tbh but yeah, pretty wild."

**Emoji overload:**
- ❌ "So excited 🎉 to share 📢 this amazing 🌟 opportunity 🚀"
- ✅ One emoji max, or none
- ✅ "This is wild 🤯"

### Fake Humility
AI doesn't know how to be genuinely humble:

**Performative modesty:**
- ❌ "I'm just a simple [role]"
- ❌ "I'm no expert but..."
- ❌ "Who am I to say, but..."
- ❌ "Not to toot my own horn but..."

**Real humility:**
- ✅ "Still learning this"
- ✅ "Could be wrong here"
- ✅ "Probably overthinking it"
- ✅ "idk man"

## The Personality Problem

### No Distinct Voice
AI sounds like it could be anyone:

**Generic statements:**
- ❌ "I believe in the power of teamwork"
- ❌ "Success comes from hard work"
- ❌ "Always learning and growing"

**Specific voice:**
- ✅ "I'm a sucker for well-documented code"
- ✅ "Give me messy honesty over polished bullshit"
- ✅ "Coffee-driven development is my actual methodology"

### Lacks Quirks
Real people have:
- Phrases they overuse
- Topics they're weird about
- Specific references
- Running jokes
- Opinions that show through

AI has:
- Perfect balance
- No strong opinions
- Generic references
- No recurring themes

## The Grammar Problem

### Too Perfect
AI follows every grammar rule:

**Overly correct:**
- ❌ Never starts with "And" or "But"
- ❌ No sentence fragments. Ever.
- ❌ Always uses "whom" correctly
- ❌ Never splits infinitives
- ❌ Perfect punctuation always

**Human variation:**
- ✅ And sometimes starts with conjunctions
- ✅ Fragments. For emphasis.
- ✅ Who cares about whom
- ✅ Gonna boldly split infinitives
- ✅ Typos happen

### Comma Splice Avoidance
Humans do comma splices, AI doesn't:
- ❌ "It was raining. I stayed inside." (technically correct, feels stilted)
- ✅ "It was raining, I stayed inside." (comma splice, sounds natural)
- ✅ "It was raining so I stayed inside."

## The Rhythm Problem

### No Variation
AI makes sentences too similar in:
- Length (usually medium)
- Structure (usually compound)
- Complexity (usually balanced)

Humans:
- Vary wildly
- Short sentences. Then really long ones that go on and on and might even have multiple clauses and subclauses because the thought just kept developing as they wrote.
- Mix simple and complex
- Sometimes just fragments

### No Breathing Room
AI fills every space:
- No "anyway"
- No "so yeah"
- No trailing off...
- No conversational pauses

Humans leave gaps.

## The Context Problem

### One-Size-Fits-All Tone
AI uses the same voice for:
- Tweets
- LinkedIn posts
- Blog articles
- Comments
- DMs

Humans code-switch. Same person sounds different on:
- Twitter (casual, reactive)
- LinkedIn (professional, thoughtful)
- Reddit (community-aware, informal)
- Email (varies by recipient)
- Text (ultra-compressed)

## The Question Problem

### Rhetorical Questions as Hooks
AI loves these:
- ❌ "Have you ever wondered why..."
- ❌ "What if I told you..."
- ❌ "Did you know that..."
- ❌ "Ever notice how..."

Humans ask questions differently:
- ✅ Direct questions: "Why does [thing] do [thing]?"
- ✅ Frustrated questions: "seriously why"
- ✅ Genuine inquiry: "anyone know about this?"

### Engagement Bait Questions
AI ends posts with:
- ❌ "What are your thoughts?"
- ❌ "Do you agree?"
- ❌ "What would you add?"
- ❌ "Thoughts?"

Humans:
- ✅ Specific questions about the topic
- ✅ Sometimes no question at all
- ✅ "Am I crazy or..."
- ✅ "Is this just me?"

## The Reference Problem

### Generic Examples
AI uses:
- Generic industry names
- Hypothetical scenarios
- "Company X" and "Product Y"
- Universal truths

Humans reference:
- Specific companies/products
- Personal experiences
- Recent news
- Memes and culture
- Their actual life

### No Cultural Context
AI misses:
- Generational language
- Platform-specific memes
- Industry in-jokes
- Regional expressions
- Temporal markers

Humans are embedded in culture.

## The Certainty Problem

### False Precision
AI sounds too confident:
- ❌ "This will definitely..."
- ❌ "Always remember to..."
- ❌ "The best way is..."
- ❌ "You should never..."

Humans hedge naturally:
- ✅ "This usually works"
- ✅ "Try to remember"
- ✅ "What works for me"
- ✅ "Generally avoid"

### No Doubt
AI doesn't show uncertainty:
- Never says "I think?"
- Never says "maybe"
- Never says "idk"
- Never contradicts itself

Humans second-guess constantly.

## The Temporal Problem

### No Real-Time Anchoring
AI doesn't exist in time:

**Generic time references:**
- ❌ "In today's fast-paced world..."
- ❌ "In recent years..."
- ❌ "As we move forward..."
- ❌ "In this day and age..."
- ❌ "Currently..."

**Humans anchor in real time:**
- ✅ "last Tuesday when I..."
- ✅ "the other day I saw..."
- ✅ "since like 2019 or so"
- ✅ "remember when [recent event] happened?"
- ✅ References to seasons, holidays, current events
- ✅ "it's been like 3 weeks since..."

**The tell:**
AI can't reference what happened yesterday, last week, or in the news. It exists in a timeless void. Humans are anchored in the present moment.

## The Number Problem

### Suspiciously Round Numbers
AI loves neat, clean quantities:

**Always round:**
- ❌ "5 tips for..."
- ❌ "10 ways to..."
- ❌ "3 simple steps"
- ❌ "7 habits of..."
- ❌ "thousands of people"
- ❌ "many experts agree"

**Humans are messier:**
- ✅ "like 7 or 8 things"
- ✅ "a couple hundred maybe?"
- ✅ "worked there for 2 years and 4 months"
- ✅ "about 37 people showed up"
- ✅ "idk, a few dozen?"
- ✅ "somewhere between 12-15"

**Why it matters:**
Real people don't think in perfect increments. They estimate, approximate, and hedge on specifics.

## The Filler Word Problem

### Missing Verbal Tics
AI writes too cleanly:

**Never uses:**
- ❌ "like" (as filler)
- ❌ "basically"
- ❌ "literally"
- ❌ "you know"
- ❌ "honestly" (randomly placed)
- ❌ "I mean"
- ❌ "right?"

**Humans pepper these in:**
- ✅ "like, I get it but..."
- ✅ "basically the whole thing was..."
- ✅ "I literally cannot"
- ✅ "you know what I mean?"
- ✅ "honestly idk"
- ✅ "I mean, sure, but..."

**The rhythm:**
These words serve no grammatical purpose—they're conversational texture. Their absence makes writing feel sterile.

## The Capitalization Problem

### Too Consistent
AI follows all the rules:

**Always correct:**
- ❌ Perfect sentence case
- ❌ Proper nouns always capitalized
- ❌ "I" always capitalized
- ❌ Consistent brand names

**Humans are chaotic:**
- ✅ all lowercase for casual vibes
- ✅ Random CAPS for emphasis
- ✅ "idk" not "I don't know"
- ✅ "iphone" and "iPhone" in same paragraph
- ✅ "ok" "OK" "okay" "Okay" all interchangeable
- ✅ Sometimes forgetting caps after periods

**Platform patterns:**
- Twitter/X: often all lowercase
- LinkedIn: properly capitalized
- Texts: whatever, no rules
- Reddit: inconsistent by design

## The Self-Contradiction Problem

### Never Changes Its Mind
AI commits to its first thought:

**AI is linear:**
- ❌ Point A leads to Point B leads to Point C
- ❌ Never backtracks
- ❌ Never says "actually wait"
- ❌ No visible thinking process

**Humans interrupt themselves:**
- ✅ "Actually wait, no—"
- ✅ "Well, maybe not that exactly, but..."
- ✅ "I said X earlier but now I'm thinking..."
- ✅ "hmm, scratch that"
- ✅ "or actually... yeah no, original point stands"
- ✅ "idk if that made sense"

**Why it matters:**
Real thinking is messy. Humans change their minds mid-sentence, contradict themselves, and work through ideas in real-time.

## The Sensory Absence Problem

### Abstract Over Concrete
AI describes concepts, not experiences:

**AI writes:**
- ❌ "The environment was pleasant"
- ❌ "I felt anxious"
- ❌ "It was an uncomfortable situation"
- ❌ "The experience was memorable"

**Humans use senses:**
- ✅ "The office smelled like old coffee and stress"
- ✅ "That cold dread in your chest when you realize"
- ✅ "my hands were literally shaking"
- ✅ "couldn't get warm the rest of the day"
- ✅ "that sick feeling when you see their name pop up"
- ✅ "my stomach dropped"

**The pattern:**
Humans write from embodied experience. AI writes from conceptual understanding. One feels lived, the other feels described.

## The Over-Helpful Problem

### Explains Too Much
AI anticipates every possible confusion:

**AI does:**
- ❌ Defines common terms
- ❌ Provides context nobody asked for
- ❌ Explains obvious implications
- ❌ "What I mean by this is..."
- ❌ Adds unnecessary clarifications
- ❌ "In other words..."

**Humans assume context:**
- ✅ References things without explaining
- ✅ Assumes shared knowledge
- ✅ Leaves some things unexplained
- ✅ Uses jargon without defining it
- ✅ "you know the thing where..."
- ✅ Inside jokes and shorthand

**The vibe:**
AI writes like it's talking to a stranger who might not understand anything. Humans write like they're talking to someone who gets it.

## The Abbreviation Problem

### Weirdly Formal Contractions
AI avoids casual shortcuts:

**AI writes out:**
- ❌ "I do not know"
- ❌ "that is to say"
- ❌ "to be honest"
- ❌ "as far as I know"
- ❌ "in my opinion"
- ❌ "let me know"

**Humans abbreviate:**
- ✅ "idk"
- ✅ "ie" or "i.e." 
- ✅ "tbh"
- ✅ "afaik"
- ✅ "imo" / "imho"
- ✅ "lmk"
- ✅ "ngl" (not gonna lie)
- ✅ "fr" (for real)
- ✅ "rn" (right now)

**Platform-specific:**
- Gen Z: "no bc" "pls" "ur" "w/" "b/w"
- Millennials: "lol" "omg" "brb" "ttyl"
- Professional: fewer abbrevs but still "btw" "fyi" "asap"

**The tell:**
If someone types "I don't know" instead of "idk" in a casual context, they're either being formal or they're AI.

## Detection Exercise

Compare these:

**AI-written:**
"I'm excited to share my thoughts on productivity. Furthermore, I believe that establishing a morning routine is essential for success. Additionally, one should consider the importance of work-life balance. In conclusion, these practices will help you achieve your goals."

**Human-written:**
"okay so productivity. been thinking about this a lot lately. morning routines help (obv) but like, balance matters too? idk still figuring it out"

Spot the difference:
- Structure (rigid vs loose)
- Vocabulary (formal vs casual)
- Certainty (confident vs uncertain)
- Emotion (artificial vs genuine)
- Flow (mechanical vs natural)

## The Ultimate Test

If you:
- Can't hear someone saying it out loud
- Can't identify a single personality trait
- Could swap any word for a synonym without losing meaning
- See zero imperfections
- Feel like it could be about anything/anyone

It's probably AI.

## Remember

The goal isn't to write "badly"—it's to write like a human being. Humans are articulate, intelligent, and effective communicators. They just don't sound like they're trying to pass a corporate communications exam.

They sound like themselves.
