# Twitter/X Voice Guide

How people actually write on Twitter when they're being authentic, not when they're being "brand voices."

## The Twitter Vibe

Twitter is where people:
- Think out loud
- Make observations
- Share hot takes
- Process emotions publicly
- Test ideas before they're fully formed

It's NOT primarily:
- A press release platform
- A place for essays (threads exist but they're specific)
- Professional networking (that's LinkedIn)
- Formal announcements

## Length & Structure

### The Sweet Spot
- 40-100 characters: punchy observation
- 100-200 characters: full thought with setup
- 200-280: complete idea with nuance

### When to Thread
**Thread-worthy:**
- Story with narrative arc
- Technical explanation
- Multiple related observations
- "Here's what happened" breakdown

**NOT thread-worthy:**
- Single thought stretched thin
- What could be a paragraph
- Engagement farming (multiple tweets of "1. Coming soon...")

### Thread Setup
Natural: "some thoughts on [topic]"
Natural: "okay so this is nuts" then numbered
Natural: Just start, no announcement

Corporate: "🧵 THREAD: Everything you need to know..."
Corporate: "A thread on why [thing] (1/47)"

## Tone Patterns

### Observations
Real Twitter energy:
- "the way everyone suddenly..."
- "watching people discover [thing] in real time"
- "not to be controversial but [mild take]"
- "it's the [specific detail] for me"

### Hot Takes
How humans do it:
- "unpopular opinion: [take]"
- "gonna get dragged for this but"
- "look I'm just saying"
- No hedging, straight to point: "[take], that's it"

### Excitement
Authentic:
- "okay this is actually wild"
- "I'm not okay" [about something good]
- "screaming crying throwing up" [hyperbolically]
- Understated: "pretty cool" [about something huge]

Fake:
- "🚀 Thrilled to announce 🚀"
- "Over the moon about..."
- "Blessed and grateful to..."

## Conversation Style

### Quote Tweets Energy
Even without QT, tweets reference others:
- "this but unironically"
- "say it louder for the people in the back"
- "adding to this:"
- "counterpoint:"

### Agreeing
- "this this this"
- "big if true"
- "yep" [quoting the whole tweet]
- "cannot emphasize this enough"

### Disagreeing
- "hard disagree"
- "counterpoint: [thing]"
- "nah"
- "respectfully, this ain't it"

## Humor Styles

### Self-Deprecating
- "my therapist is gonna love this one"
- "once again I am [doing thing]"
- "the bar is on the floor and yet"
- "I'm a disaster and here's why"

### Absurdist
- "in this essay I will [does not write essay]"
- "top 10 anime betrayals"
- "we live in a simulation"
- "[mundane thing] lore just dropped"

### Observational
- "the duality of man" [contradictory screenshots]
- "tell me you [thing] without telling me"
- "POV:" [usually used incorrectly, that's the joke]
- "no one: / literally nobody: / [person/thing]:"

### Deadpan
- "interesting"
- "incredible"
- "cool cool cool"
- "neat" [about chaos]

## Timing & Context

### The Meta Game
Twitter is self-referential:
- "this tweet aged well/poorly"
- "ratio'd" (even without the metric)
- "main character of the day"
- "log off" [to self or others]

### Current Events
People jump on trends:
- "[news] discourse is wild"
- "not the [thing] this is crazy"
- "we're all thinking it"
- No explanation needed if everyone knows

## Authenticity Markers

### Real People
- Reply to themselves to add thoughts
- Delete and retweet with edits
- "update:" or "correction:"
- Leave typos unless they're egregious
- "anyway"

### Real Emotion
- "genuinely" (when they mean it)
- "actually" (for emphasis)
- "literally" (hyperbolic or literal)
- All caps for ONE word in sentence

### Real Uncertainty
- "idk man"
- "maybe it's just me"
- "could be wrong"
- "???" [as its own tweet]

## What Kills It

### Corporate Voice Bleed
❌ "Excited to share"
❌ "Thrilled to announce"
❌ "Proud to present"
❌ "Humble" anything
❌ Every tweet with an emoji
❌ Hashtag spam

### Try-Hard Viral
❌ "This will blow your mind"
❌ "Thread on [obvious thing] everyone's missing"
❌ "RT if you agree"
❌ "I'll wait" [after question]

### Fake Casual
❌ "Hot take: [extremely common opinion]"
❌ "Am I the only one..." [no, you're not]
❌ "Why is no one talking about..." [everyone is]

## Platform-Specific Elements

### Character Limit Strategy
Don't treat it like a constraint to game, treat it like Twitter:
- Make complete thought in available space
- If it needs more, thread it
- Don't abbreviate weirdly to fit
- Do use natural compression ("gonna" not "going to")

### Linebreaks
Use them like real people:

One thought

Another thought

Not:
Everything
On
Separate
Lines

Or:
Everythingjammedtogetherinablockoftext

### Emoji Use
- Not every tweet needs one
- When used: end of tweet or inline naturally
- Not: 🔥 forcing 💯 emoji 🚀 between 💪 words
- Reaction tweets can be just emoji (but sparingly)

## Voice Examples

### Tech Twitter
"the amount of times I've rewritten this function is honestly embarrassing"
"okay but why is [framework] docs like this"
"everything is terrible and nothing works but hey it compiles"

### Shitposting
"society if [thing]: [utopia image]"
"the multiverse of madness is just [mundane situation]"
"tired: [thing] / wired: [thing]"

### Thoughtful
"been thinking about how we [observation]"
"the thing about [topic] that doesn't get discussed enough"
"maybe unpopular but I think [nuanced take]"

### Personal
"currently: [mundane activity] and feeling some type of way about it"
"why do I always [self-aware observation]"
"note to self: [thing]"

## The Vibe Check

Read your tweet out loud. Does it sound like:
- ✅ A person talking to friends at a bar
- ✅ Someone thinking out loud
- ✅ A real observation from a real human
- ❌ A press release
- ❌ An advertisement
- ❌ Someone trying too hard to go viral

If it passes the "would someone actually say this" test, you're good.

## Remember

Twitter rewards:
- Authenticity over polish
- Wit over wordiness
- Personality over perfection
- Relatability over authority

The best tweets feel like someone just... said something. Not like they crafted content.
